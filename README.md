# Movie-Recommender-System

This project is inspired by the recommendation system that we can see in our daily lives. I decided to try building a recommendation system using machine learning so I looked up resources online and decided to go with collaboraive filtering, content-based and possibly hybrid model to design the recommendation system. Each method has its own strengths and weakenesses, for instance, collaborative filtering would not work with new additions as the system can't create an embedding for it and can't query the model with this item.
